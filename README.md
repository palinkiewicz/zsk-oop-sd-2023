# OOP And Software Design Lessons 2023/2024

### Keep in mind that this is not an example of a good project or a showcase of my skills!
<br>

This is the repository I use to commit what I do during Objective-Oriented Programming and Software Design lessons in my school during the school year 2023/2024.

This year we study Laravel and Git (and that's why I need to commit it somewhere).

Code may feel disorganised and pointless as it is only for educational purposes.
