This is the repository I use to commit what I do during Objective-Oriented Programming and Software Design lessons in my school (Zespół Szkoł Komunikacji im. Hipolita Cegielskiego in Poznań, Poland) during the school year 2023/2024.

This year we study
- Laravel
- C#
- Git (that's why I was asked to make this repo).
